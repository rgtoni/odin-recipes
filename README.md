Over the course of the FOundations I have learned how to use the linux terminal to create directories, move into those directories, create files, delete files, and open files with VS Code. 

Not only that but I have also learned how to use git and github to save repositories of my projects and connect it to my machine so that I could use git to commit, stage, and publish projects on Github. 

Now I am using what I learned with HTML to complete my first project and hope to post it on Github!
